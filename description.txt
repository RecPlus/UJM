- Life fruit only will be dropped in underground jungle

------------------------------------------

Terraria has 3 official biome mimics: Corrput, Crimson and hallow mimic. But there's a hidden biome mimic, the jungle mimic. In vanilla this mimic cant be spwaned and it doesnt has any drop, and the question is: What this mod does?, Exactly, this mod adds loot and spawn to the jungle mimic.

This mimic spawns 
different that another biome mimics, this mimic spawns
killing any underworld jungle enemy (incluiding mods enemies) with 1 to 
750 chance.

This mimic drops the next stuff:

- Thorn Hook (yes, the same that drops plantera)

- Feral Lance (melee)

- Wildubra Venum (magic)

- Tortoise Hunter (ranged)

- Leaf Wings (The same that sells the witch doctor)

- Jungle stuff (spores, stingers and vines)

- Life Fruit (1/10 chance)

To summon the mimic manually, you need to craft the moosy key.
To craft the key you need:

- 3 souls of light

- 3 souls of night

- 3 jungle  spores

- 1 vine

- 3 stingers

Pd1: To craft the key you need a Work Bench
Pd2: Idk how the biome mimics summon system works, therefore
     (for now) this mimic summons like a normal boss
